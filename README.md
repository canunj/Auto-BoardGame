# Auto-BG
LLM-based text generation tool for creating board game concepts (description & title)

The Auto-BG (Board Game) tool is a text generation tool for creating board game concepts. It utilizes multiple large-language models to generate board game titles and descriptions tailored from user-input tags based on BoardGameGeek.com. The models used in this project include a trained T5 sequence-to-sequence model, primarily for title generation, and a robust GPT3 model for board game description generation. The T5 model was initially presented by Raffel et al. in ["Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf). The GPT3 model builds from Brown et al.'s work in ["Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).
